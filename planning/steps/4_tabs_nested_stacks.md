# Step 4: Tabs + Nested Stacks

1) **Create (tabs) group and four tab stacks**
- Set up the tab bar and nested stack layouts per tab.
- Files to create/change: `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/*/_layout.tsx`.
- Expected result: Chat, Map, Agenda, Profile tabs with nested stack routes (no modals).

2) **Add placeholder tab screens**
- Scaffold the main tab screens and wire auth logout actions where needed.
- Files to create/change: `app/(tabs)/chat/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/map/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/agenda/index.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/profile/index.tsx`.
- Expected result: Tabs render with placeholder content and working navigation.
