# Planning Hub

This folder is the single source of truth for how to build, evolve, and maintain `react-native-ignite-kit`. If you are an AI agent or a new contributor, start here.

## What to Read First
1) `planning/codex-config.md` - project rules, architecture, and coding constraints.
2) `planning/progress-plan.md` - phase-by-phase build guide and upcoming work.
3) `planning/history.md` - chronological log of changes and decisions.

## How This Fits Together
- Use `codex-config.md` as the strict rulebook.
- Use `progress-plan.md` as the step-by-step execution path.
- Use `history.md` to understand what already happened, why it changed, and what files were touched.

## When Updating
- Keep entries human-readable and short.
- Update `planning/history.md` after meaningful work.
